# Lyco

Lyco a.k.a. MassTextMachine is a web app for sending SMS messages to a large batch of recipients (mass texting).
It requires an account with the SMS service provider Twilio.

The web server is written in the Ruby language and requires a Redis database.

[![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/jackwillis/lyco.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/github/jackwillis/lyco/)

## Local installation

1. [Download](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) Ruby 2.7.0.
Ruby works on Windows, but works better on Linux and macOS.

2. [Set up](https://redis.io/topics/quickstart) or provision a Redis server.

3. Download this repository and install the RubyGem bundle.

```
git clone git@github.com:jackwillis/lyco.git
cd lyco
bundle install
```

## Usage

1. Run the web server with `bundle exec rackup`.
The command must be run with these environment variables set:

Name | Description
--- | ---
`TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` | Twilio Account SID
`TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` | [Twilio Auth Token](https://support.twilio.com/hc/en-us/articles/223136027-Auth-Tokens-and-How-to-Change-Them)
`TWILIO_SENDER` | Your Twilio phone number. In development, use `+15005550006`.
`HTTP_BASIC_USERNAME` | [HTTP Basic Auth](https://demo.twilio.com/welcome/sms/) username for your lyco instance (this is a single-user app)
`HTTP_BASIC_PASSWORD` | HTTP Basic Auth password
`REDIS_URL` | URL of your Redis instance, e.g. `redis://127.0.0.1:6379`
`INSTANCE_NAME` | (optional) The name of your instance, e.g. `My Great Organization`

2. To make use of the auto-reply/forwarding feature,
make sure your web server is publicly accessible and using HTTPS.  
Set your Twilio "Inbound Request Config" setting to `https://` + `<username>` + `:` + `<password>` + `@` + `<host>` + `/echo`.

## Development and testing

This app uses the Sinatra web framework and is structured kind of like a Rails app.

RSpec tests cover most of the server code:

```
bundle exec rspec
```

Run the Ruby linter:

```
bundle exec rubocop
```

To run the Javascript linter, have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) installed,
do `npm install` and run:

```
npm run test
```

## Browser support

Lyco works on all current web browsers.
Viewing the activity logs requires Javascript.

## Goals

* Re-do activity logging
  * Store activity logs in a database
  * Use AJAX polling to update activity log view
  * Get rid of dependency on sinatra-websocket
* Change unsubscribe behavior
  * Don't forward `STOP` messages
  * Store list of unsubscribed users in a database
  * Don't try to send messages to unsubscribed users (wastes money)
* ~~Get rid of dependency on jQuery~~
* Use ES2016+ Javascript features.
* Use HTML flash messages so the app gives users more feedback and works better without Javascript.
* Write full RSpec coverage
* Pass RuboCop and standard lints
* Write tests for JS
* Improve authentication
