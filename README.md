# Lyco

Lyco (new name pending) is a web app for sending SMS messages to a large batch of recipients (mass texting).
It is specific to the SMS provider Twilio.
It is built with the Ruby programming language and the Sinatra web framework.

![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/jackwillis/lyco.svg?branch=master)

## Installation

1. [Install Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) and [set up a Redis server](https://redis.io/topics/quickstart).

2. Download the repository and install the RubyGem bundle.

```
git clone git@github.com:jackwillis/lyco.git
cd lyco
bundle install
```

## Usage

1. Set up the proper environment variables:

Name | Description
--- | ---
`TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` | Twilio Account SID
`TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` | [Twilio Auth Token](https://support.twilio.com/hc/en-us/articles/223136027-Auth-Tokens-and-How-to-Change-Them)
`TWILIO_SENDER` | Twilio phone number
`HTTP_BASIC_USERNAME` | [HTTP Basic Auth](https://demo.twilio.com/welcome/sms/) username for your lyco instance (this is a single-user app)
`HTTP_BASIC_PASSWORD` | HTTP Basic Auth password
`REDIS_URL` | URL of your Redis instance, e.g. `redis://127.0.0.1:6379`
`INSTANCE_NAME` | The name of your instance, e.g. `My Great Organization` (optional)

2. Start the web server with `bundle exec rackup`.

3. To make use of the auto-reply/forwarding feature,
make sure your web server is publicly accessible and using HTTPS.  
Set your Twilio "Inbound Request Config" setting to `https://` + `<username>` + `:` + `<password>` + `@` + `<host>` + `/echo`.

## Testing

RSpec tests cover most of the server code.

```
bundle exec rspec
```

## Goals

* Get rid of dependency on `sinatra-websocket`
* Full RSpec coverage and tests for JS
* Improve authentication
